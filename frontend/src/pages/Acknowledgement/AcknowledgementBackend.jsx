<p>{`          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and`}</p>
<p>{`      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices`}</p>
<p>{`          stating that You changed the files; and`}</p>
<p>{`      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works`}</p>
<p>{`          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and`}</p>
<p>{`          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,`}</p>
<p>{`          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of`}</p>
<p>{`          the Derivative Works; and`}</p>
<p>{`      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its`}</p>
<p>{`          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must`}</p>
<p>{`          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained`}</p>
<p>{`          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not`}</p>
<p>{`          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one`}</p>
<p>{`          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed`}</p>
<p>{`          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or`}</p>
<p>{`          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,`}</p>
<p>{`          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and`}</p>
<p>{`          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents`}</p>
<p>{`          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and`}</p>
<p>{`          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution`}</p>
<p>{`          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside`}</p>
<p>{`          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided`}</p>
<p>{`          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed`}</p>
<p>{`          as modifying the License.`}</p>
<p>{`      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and`}</p>
<p>{`      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions`}</p>
<p>{`      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or`}</p>
<p>{`      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,`}</p>
<p>{`      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with`}</p>
<p>{`      the conditions stated in this License.`}</p>
<p>{`   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,`}</p>
<p>{`      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work`}</p>
<p>{`      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of`}</p>
<p>{`      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.`}</p>
<p>{`      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify`}</p>
<p>{`      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed`}</p>
<p>{`      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.`}</p>
<p>{`   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade`}</p>
<p>{`      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,`}</p>
<p>{`      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the`}</p>
<p>{`      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.`}</p>
<p>{`   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or`}</p>
<p>{`      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each`}</p>
<p>{`      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,`}</p>
<p>{`      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or`}</p>
<p>{`      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions`}</p>
<p>{`      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A`}</p>
<p>{`      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the`}</p>
<p>{`      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any`}</p>
<p>{`      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.`}</p>
<p>{`   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,`}</p>
<p>{`      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,`}</p>
<p>{`      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly`}</p>
<p>{`      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be`}</p>
<p>{`      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,`}</p>
<p>{`      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a`}</p>
<p>{`      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the`}</p>
<p>{`      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,`}</p>
<p>{`      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all`}</p>
<p>{`      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor`}</p>
<p>{`      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.`}</p>
<p>{`   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing`}</p>
<p>{`      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,`}</p>
<p>{`      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,`}</p>
<p>{`      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this`}</p>
<p>{`      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only`}</p>
<p>{`      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf`}</p>
<p>{`      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,`}</p>
<p>{`      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability`}</p>
<p>{`      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason`}</p>
<p>{`      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.`}</p>
<p>{`   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS`}</p>
<p>{`   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.`}</p>

<p>{`      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)`}</p>

<p>{`      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate`}</p>

<p>{`   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the`}</p>
<p>{`      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without`}</p>
<p>{`      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You`}</p>
<p>{`      meet the following conditions:`}</p>
<p>{`      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or`}</p>
<p>{`          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and`}</p>
<p>{`      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices`}</p>
<p>{`          stating that You changed the files; and`}</p>
<p>{`      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works`}</p>
<p>{`          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and`}</p>
<p>{`          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,`}</p>
<p>{`          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of`}</p>
<p>{`          the Derivative Works; and`}</p>
<p>{`      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its`}</p>
<p>{`          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must`}</p>
<p>{`          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained`}</p>
<p>{`          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not`}</p>
<p>{`          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one`}</p>
<p>{`          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed`}</p>
<p>{`          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or`}</p>
<p>{`          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,`}</p>
<p>{`          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and`}</p>
<p>{`          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents`}</p>
<p>{`          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and`}</p>
<p>{`          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution`}</p>
<p>{`          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside`}</p>
<p>{`          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided`}</p>
<p>{`          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed`}</p>
<p>{`          as modifying the License.`}</p>
<p>{`      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and`}</p>
<p>{`      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions`}</p>
<p>{`      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or`}</p>
<p>{`      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,`}</p>
<p>{`      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with`}</p>
<p>{`      the conditions stated in this License.`}</p>
<p>{`   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,`}</p>
<p>{`      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work`}</p>
<p>{`      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of`}</p>
<p>{`      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.`}</p>
<p>{`      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify`}</p>
<p>{`      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed`}</p>
<p>{`      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.`}</p>
<p>{`   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade`}</p>
<p>{`      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,`}</p>
<p>{`      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the`}</p>
<p>{`      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.`}</p>
<p>{`   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or`}</p>
<p>{`      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each`}</p>
<p>{`      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,`}</p>
<p>{`      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or`}</p>
<p>{`      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions`}</p>
<p>{`      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A`}</p>
<p>{`      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the`}</p>
<p>{`      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any`}</p>
<p>{`      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.`}</p>
<p>{`   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,`}</p>
<p>{`      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,`}</p>
<p>{`      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly`}</p>
<p>{`      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be`}</p>
<p>{`      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,`}</p>
<p>{`      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a`}</p>
<p>{`      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the`}</p>
<p>{`      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,`}</p>
<p>{`      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all`}</p>
<p>{`      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor`}</p>
<p>{`      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.`}</p>
<p>{`   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing`}</p>
<p>{`      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,`}</p>
<p>{`      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,`}</p>
<p>{`      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this`}</p>
<p>{`      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only`}</p>
<p>{`      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf`}</p>
<p>{`      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,`}</p>
<p>{`      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability`}</p>
<p>{`      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason`}</p>
<p>{`      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.`}</p>
<p>{`   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS`}</p>
<p>{`   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.`}</p>

<p>{`      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)`}</p>

<p>{`   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the`}</p>

<p>{`          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and`}</p>
<p>{`      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices`}</p>
<p>{`          stating that You changed the files; and`}</p>
<p>{`      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works`}</p>
<p>{`          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and`}</p>
<p>{`          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,`}</p>
<p>{`          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of`}</p>
<p>{`          the Derivative Works; and`}</p>
<p>{`      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its`}</p>
<p>{`          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must`}</p>
<p>{`          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained`}</p>
<p>{`          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not`}</p>
<p>{`          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one`}</p>
<p>{`          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed`}</p>
<p>{`          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or`}</p>
<p>{`          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,`}</p>
<p>{`          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and`}</p>
<p>{`          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents`}</p>
<p>{`          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and`}</p>
<p>{`          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution`}</p>
<p>{`          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside`}</p>
<p>{`          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided`}</p>
<p>{`          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed`}</p>
<p>{`          as modifying the License.`}</p>
<p>{`      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and`}</p>
<p>{`      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions`}</p>
<p>{`      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or`}</p>
<p>{`      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,`}</p>
<p>{`      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with`}</p>
<p>{`      the conditions stated in this License.`}</p>
<p>{`   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,`}</p>
<p>{`      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work`}</p>
<p>{`      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of`}</p>
<p>{`      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.`}</p>
<p>{`      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify`}</p>
<p>{`      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed`}</p>
<p>{`      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.`}</p>
<p>{`   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade`}</p>
<p>{`      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,`}</p>
<p>{`      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the`}</p>
<p>{`      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.`}</p>
<p>{`   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or`}</p>
<p>{`      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each`}</p>
<p>{`      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,`}</p>
<p>{`      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or`}</p>
<p>{`      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions`}</p>
<p>{`      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A`}</p>
<p>{`      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the`}</p>
<p>{`      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any`}</p>
<p>{`      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.`}</p>
<p>{`   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,`}</p>
<p>{`      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,`}</p>
<p>{`      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly`}</p>
<p>{`      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be`}</p>
<p>{`      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,`}</p>
<p>{`      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a`}</p>
<p>{`      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the`}</p>
<p>{`      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,`}</p>
<p>{`      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all`}</p>
<p>{`      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor`}</p>
<p>{`      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.`}</p>
<p>{`   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing`}</p>
<p>{`      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,`}</p>
<p>{`      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,`}</p>
<p>{`      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this`}</p>
<p>{`      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only`}</p>
<p>{`      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf`}</p>
<p>{`      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,`}</p>
<p>{`      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability`}</p>
<p>{`      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason`}</p>
<p>{`      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.`}</p>
<p>{`   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS`}</p>
<p>{`   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.`}</p>
